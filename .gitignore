# User Data (if you want to keep it local only, though for Render persistence you usually need a database)
# For now, we'll keep userSettings.json in the repo so it doesn't crash on start, 
# but normally you'd gitignore it if it was sensitive. 
# Since it's just preferences, committing the initial empty one is fine, but we should ignore updates.
# Actually, let's keep data/userSettings.json tracked initially so the bot starts.
